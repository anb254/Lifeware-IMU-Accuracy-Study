Convert raw OMC data to corresponding arrays in Matlab, that are labeled according to the marker name. Marker names correspond to the sensor (i.e., A=C7/T1, B=T12/L1, C=L4/L5, D=thigh) and location of marker (ie., L=left, R=right, T=top as depicted in 'Marker Labels.PNG' file).
Run Vicon_Alignment_8_25.m, which calls vicon_align_est_8_25.m to get the R_body_OMClocal rotation matrices for each sensor.
Run Accuracy_Vicon_Dynamic_8_25.m, which derives ROM for each segment and calls the following three additional functions to derive Euler angles based on different orders of decomposition: rmx2eul_xyz, rmx2eul_yxz, rmx2eul_zxy
