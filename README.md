# Lifeware-IMU-Accuracy-Study
Custom Matlab codes used to derive results discussed in 'Assessing the the reliability and validity of inertial measurement units to measure three-dimensional spine and hip kinematics during clinical movement tasks'


This repository contains codes to derive range of motion from Vicon (OMC) data and IMU data. 

Coordinate systems are as follows:

Vicon: +x = right, +y = forward, +z = up

IMU (L5 and Hip): +x = down, +y = right, +z = backward

IMU (T1 and L1)*: +x = up, +y = left, +z = backward

*The T1 and L1 sensors were placed upside down to prevent the sensors and attached OMC markers from hitting each other during movement
